# Project Status: Archived

This project is currently archived and not under active development.

## Why Archived?

The development of this custom NER model was put on hold for the following reasons:
- **Lack of quality training data.** Creating a reliable dataset through manual annotation required more resources than were available.
- **Practical decision for the main project.** For the Telegram bot (MR.REMINDER), using a third-party API (like Yandex GPT) and simple heuristics proved to be a faster and more efficient solution for the current stage.
- **Shift of focus.** An initial goal was learning with deep understanding, practice NLP and understand my interests. Now I understand that I like CV more.

## What's Inside?
This repo contains my initial experiments with NER. The code is in an experimental state and has some bugs and shortcomings.

## Future Considerations
I might revisit this idea if:
- I find a way to get a large, labeled dataset efficiently.
- I decide to develop the bot further and it scales to a point where using an API becomes too expensive or limiting.
- I decide to tackle the problem with a different approach (e.g., a Text-to-Text model).
